<title>A Close Call</title>
<description>
Beirut A Close Call A demonstrator walks past burning tires during protests on October 17 against Lebanon’s plan to tax calls made on WhatsApp, FaceTime and other apps. Hours later the government reversed course on the 20 cent daily fee. But in the midst of an economic crisis with the government declaring a state of “economic emergency” and public debts totaling 150 percent of gross domestic product, uncertainty remains.

<title>Cry From the Heart</title>
<description>
Port-au-Prince, Haiti Cry From the Heart A girl cries during her father’s funeral on October 16. The city has been paralyzed by anti-corruption protests for more than six weeks with mounting calls for President Jovenel Moise to resign. Tens of thousands of people have flooded the streets and 18 people have died in violent clashes. On top of a fuel shortage, Haitians are also struggling with a lack of access to safe water and food. Half of the country’s population lives below the poverty line.

<title>Broken Record</title>
<description>
Vienna. Broken Record Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge crosses the finish line on October 12 to become the first person to break the two-hour barrier for a marathon-distance run—a feat he compared to reaching the moon. The run, which was not an official marathon, was perfectly engineered and included a pace-setting laser projected from a car that was followed by pacesetters running in an aerodynamic “V” formation. Kipchoge’s final time was 1hr 59min 40.2sec.

Port-au-Prince, Haiti Burn With Rage Tires burn on city streets during a protest on September 25 against the country’s second fuel shortage this year. Due to an unreliable electricity grid, the country has depended on Venezuelan oil to power diesel generators. But sanctions, and huge government debt, have caused a fuel shortage that’s crippling hospitals, schools and businesses.

Some 200,000 Rohingya gather in the Kutupalong refugee camp on August 25 to mark the two year anniversary of a military crackdown in Myanmar.

Earlier in the week, officials failed for a second time to repatriate a small number of refugees due to their ongoing concerns about having no path to citizenship in Myanmar

A reveller is one of 22,000 people hit with tomatoes while celebrating the annual La Tomatina festival on August 28. The iconic fiesta begins each year when trucks tip more than 140 tons of tomatoes into the waiting crowd. Billed as the world’s largest food fight, it was inspired by a much smaller incident in 1945, though the details remain unclear. Tomatina was made an official festival in 1957 and has become a major draw for foreigners.

As Ukraine’s new parliament met for the first time on August 29, the influential weekly Dzerkalo Tyzhnia released a special edition dedicated to the mothers of 36 soldiers who died on the deadliest day of battle against Russian-backed separatists five years earlier. In May, comedian Volodymyr Zelensky won the presidential election and since then his party gained an outright majority—a first for any party in the country’s history.

<description>
A fire burns in part of Brazil’s Amazon on August 25 near Porto Velho. The Amazon, which is home to 1 million indigenous people in Brazil, has suffered from 40,300 fires so far this year, the fastest rate of burning since 2013, when record keeping began. Wildfires do occur during dry months, but illegal fires, which are started to deforest land for ranching or prepare already cleared land for next year’s harvest, are also common.

<title>At a Crossroads</title>
<description>
Orthodox nuns, along with tens of thousands of Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) believers, celebrate the 1,031st anniversary of the Christianization of Kievan Rus on July 27. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was granted independence from the Moscow Patriarchate, over protestations from Russia, and tens of thousands of its believers marked the same anniversary a day earlier.

<description>
A Palestinian garbage collector combs a landfill on July 29 in hopes of finding scraps he can sell to help him survive. With poverty exacerbated by undrinkable water, electricity outages and the 12-year-long Israeli blockade, some Palestinians desperate for income have resorted to scavenging through landfills. The UN estimates the unemployment rate­ in Gaza to be more than 50 percent—the highest in the world—and even higher for youth.

Residents initially took to the streets in June to march against a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam has since declared the bill “dead,” but after violent clashes protesters are demanding Lam’s resignation and greater independence from Beijing.

<title>Too Hot to Handle</title>
<description>
Two years after wildfires ravaged central Portugal killing more than 60 people and injuring dozens, the flames returned. This time some 1,700 firefighters and 400 vehicles were sent out to battle three blazes that raged across the heavily-wooded Castelo Branco region, over 100 miles north of Lisbon. As a firefighter looked at a wildfire at Amendoa in Macao on July 21, much of Europe was still sweltering through a heatwave.
